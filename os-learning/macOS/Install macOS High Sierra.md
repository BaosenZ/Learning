# Install macOS High Sierra
This procedure is for an old iMac in JHC620.\
1. Boot into macOS Recovery
Restart iMac by holding power button for several seconds or immediately press and hold `Command + R` until you see the Apple logo or a spinning globe.

2. Erase the Disk
If you determine to erase the disk, make sure that all data in the iMac is not in use (Of course, you want to erase, you should get permission from Dr. Schrier). Select the internal disk. Click on the "Erase" button. Choose a format, Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Note that other format for this iMac can give you error. Give the disk a name (I like `Mac disk`) and click "Erase."

3. Reinstall macOS
If the disk successfully erases, you can proceed to reinstall macOS: Go back to the macOS Recovery menu.
Select "Reinstall macOS" and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure you have internet connection. Follow a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouNQS36dIBw) to solve issue of "The recovery server could not be contacted.".
